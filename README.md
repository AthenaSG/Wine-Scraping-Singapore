# Wine-Scraping-Singapore
Using web scraping techniques to get prices and other necessary information from wine-searcher

Wine.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook in which I coded my webscraping application.
the other files are the files I used to test out the code to ensure its effectiveness.

Issues:
Free services cannot get through PX-Captcha easily, and I would recommend going to use a paid proxy to web-scrape.
